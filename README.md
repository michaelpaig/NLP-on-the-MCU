# NLP on the Marvel Cinematic Universe

#### Description 
Performed Natural Language Processing  techniques (TF-IDF, NMF) for topic modeling on movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe to compare with Captain Marvel. 
The goal was to see if I could see I could find any insight, similarities, and differences that I might have missed from just watching the movies.
